Documentation

This program was made by Jacky He on 01/01/2022. 

Summary

Short, abstract website that depicts a donut indefinitely falling into a pool of pink frosting.

Experience

Three dimensional objects have been something new that I've grown a liking to. I am not
particularly good at creating them (Blender, etc.) thus I used Javascript and 
THREEJS to assist me in completing this project.

Goals

In regards to this project theme, I expect and hope to update this page or make a separate 
one depicting the donut and the frosting colliding as a closing to end this coding journey 
during the month JULY in 2022.
