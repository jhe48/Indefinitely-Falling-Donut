# Falling Donut

## Documentation
This program was made by Jacky He on 01/01/2022. 

## Description
- This project is a short, abstract website that depicts a donut indefinitely falling into a pool of pink frosting. 
- For the donut, sprinkles, and animations, I used Three.js. 
- This project is still in progress. While there isnâ€™t much to progress from this, I hope to eventually implement a splashing animation once I feel very much comfortable with Three.js and perhaps other modules.

## Tools Used
- Three.js
- ViteJS
> This repository does not include these modules.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run these following commands:

``` bash

# Install dependencies (only for first time)
npm init @vitejs/app
npm install three

# Serve at localhost:3000
npm run dev

```

## Use of Project
This project requires that the user be fully entranced on the rotating donut until its next edition is released.
